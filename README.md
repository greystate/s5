# Simple Standards-based Slide Show System (S5)

A simple slideshow system originally conceived and written in 2005 as a way to recreate Operaâ€™s Presentation Mode display in any browser, using JavaScript to fill in the features Opera had natively at the time, while allowing Opera to present S5 files without needing the JS.  So far as the author is aware, Presentation Mode no longer exists in Opera.  S5 was also designed to be compatible with [the XOXO microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo), which does still exist.

The [original project](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) was eventually given a Public Domain license.  This copy of S5 uses the closest GitHub equivalent, the Unlicense.

This copy is made public as a historical reference, **not** as an active project.  Thus, Issues and Pull Requests for this repository will not be enabled or accepted.  Forks of this repository for personal use, enhancement, and development are permitted (encouraged, even).

Somewhere along the way, S5 picked up [a Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5_(file_format)), a fact which remains entirely baffling.
